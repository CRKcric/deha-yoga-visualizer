- Live video capture using OpenCV
- Pose detection using MediaPipe
- Joint angle calculation
- Posture comparison with tolerance range
- Color-coded visual feedback:
  - 🟢 Green → Correct posture
  - 🔴 Red → Incorrect posture
- Continuous real-time frame processing

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
